# Coq-uplc

The `coq-uplc` library provides a Coq-based implementation of the Cardano CEK machineâ€”the virtual
machine responsible for evaluating UPLC programs (validators), which serve as the on-chain
components of Cardano smart contracts.

The implementation of the library is funded by Project Catalyst.
